# Opt-in native integration checks

The no-model HTTP smoke checks the pairing-only public page, absence of browser app assets, and native API origin/session boundaries. It does not pair a device or consume model usage.

Native interaction QA uses signed iPhone/iPad simulator builds and the installed Mac app. Pair through the native QR/code flow and confirm matching verification text on the Mac. Test real work only with explicit authorization, and remove disposable fixtures afterward. Build-only and simulator checks do not replace physical-device acceptance.

The retired browser source, Playwright harnesses and browser build jobs have been removed. Existing historical research and dated verification records are retained as history, not current setup instructions.
